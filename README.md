# Daymians-Custom-WPF-Boilerplate

This repository contains the source code for a moderately-advanced WPF boilerplate application. It comes pre-packaged with a lot of useful, but potentially specific packages and boilerplate. I've created this repository to speed up my own projects since many of them are built with WPF, and many of those often include the boilerplate that I've already setup here. 

`TODO: Include info on what packages I've added here`
